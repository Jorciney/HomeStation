# HomeStation
This is my first Android app.
The purpose of this app was mainly to test and work with some frameworks.

Here are some of the main features of this app:
* Drawer menu
* Weather forecast
   - Here I fetched a JSON object from openweathermap
* Energy consumption
   - Data is stored and fetched direclty from a DataBase online(Firebase)
* Siding up menu
    - For this one I used a combination of the gotokatsuya/BlurredGridMenu with the  umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel
* Graphic overview
    - The graphics used here were from mpandroidchart
* Smart tab layout
   - For this one I used the ogaclejapan.smarttablayout
